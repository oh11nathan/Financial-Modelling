# Financial-Modelling
Project repo for everything related to my finance learnings.

April 8th 2025 - Completed MSFT Financial Mode
* Built from scratch using Financial Statements found in 10-K
* Learning Goals:
  * Build Integrated 3 Statement Model from scratch
  * Understand how the Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement are used to balance one another out
  * Examples of how different Line Items interact with one another and logic behind it
    * Depreciation reduces PP&E Assets
    * CapEx increases PP&E Assets
    * Paid Dividends reduces Retained Earnings
    * Etc.
* Model Improvements and Future Learnings:
  * Develop better research methods for assumptions in specific line items
  * Forecasts as a % of revenue / other metric is great for learning how the statements interact with one another but is not realistic
  * Learn how to develop scenarios within model
